There's a ton of papers out there. Some are good, some are bad, and some are
really - really important. So, here is a collection of papers that I think are
important, and one or two reasons why I think so. This is going to be broken
down loosely by subject matter, and will be updated as I go along.



### Enhancers 

#### Genetic dissection of the  alpha -globin super-enhancer in vivo

This [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3605) by Hay et al is an
excellent read. Often times in genomics we describe phenomena wich we believe
have strong biological implications. The discovery and calssifications of super
enhancers being one such instance. This paper does a great job in going into a
system (mouse) and test the hypothesis that enhancers have emergent quallities. So - if you and all your enhancer buddies are hanging out - do you get stronger? Much like Bros lifting in a gym. The answer appears to be... No.

Rather you have an additive effect between enhancers. So, nothing super
special. 

Other great takeaways:
    * Enhancer Assys don't always line up with genomic prediction. Three reported enhancers appear to have no reporting capability in vivo (granted this might be due to poor reporting assays, or requirnemtns for local
chromatin envriorments)
    * "Super" enhancers appear to offer quite a bit of backup capabilities.
      Delete one - or two (Figure 4 B/C) and you may not see any change, or any
**signifigant** change in phenotype. 
    * Looping doesn't seem to be altered by deletion of the strongest
      enhancers. For whatever reason topological assocations appear to be tough
as nails
    * Enhancer Accessible chromatin formation is NOT dependent on other
Enhancers. So if you delete the big Kahuna - all the other enhancers form just
fine

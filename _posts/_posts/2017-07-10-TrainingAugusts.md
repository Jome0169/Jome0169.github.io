#Training AUGUSTUS for genome Anotation


So, if you're like me and you're annotating a genome in 2017 you've probably
been blown away also with just how bad the documentation and resouces are. In
my extensive googling i only found a handful of blog posts (maybe 5) dealing
with augstus training data sets, and all of these blogs were from almost 5
years ago. So, i though I would make a brief how-to turtorial on how to create
an augustus training set that will (hopefully) actually work.

Let it be know right now that this the systems and examples I will be
discussing have quite alot of data, which in all honesty made my life quite a
bit easier. It should be noted that species with minimal to non-existant data
are going to have a very challenging time. But with enough patience and
attempts I am sure it can be done.

#Step 1 - Create a transcriptome 


#Step 2 - Create a Genome aligned trasncriptome

#Step 3 - Run PASA pipeline

#Step 4 - Download Databases


Alright - now're we're getting to the fun stuff
#Step 5 - Pipeline

#Step6 - Refine Genes

#Step7 - ACTUALLY RUN AND TRAIN AUGUSTUS

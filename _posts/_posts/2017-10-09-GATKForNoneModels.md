So, i just finished a project over the last months where I was working on
variant calling utalizing the GATK pipeline for a non model plant organisms.
And, like most of my projects, I wanted to write this brief guide, hopefully
giving others a sense of what this project intails, as well as provide insight
into some of the more opaque issues that they will most likely run into.

But, first things first, a warning to anyone beginning one of these projects:
THIS WILL TAKE SOME TIME. Even if you're only dealing with half a dozen
sampeles on a super cluster, GATK, while a marvel of experimental design and
data analysis takes time, because, well, it does an intense amount of analysis
under the hood.




###Creating the Golden SNPS


This is probably the part that if you're utalizing a non model organism seems
like the most opaque and challenging step. Whilethe GATK forums are expansive,
and impressive, the guides and advice on how to create this golden snp set is
spread over multople posts from different time points (from 2013 - 2018).

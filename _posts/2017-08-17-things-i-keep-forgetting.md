Madness has always been definied as the act of doing the same action and
getting different results. Bioinformatics might be the pinacle of examplar
diciplines if this is the case. Thousands of gigagbytpes of data, dozens of
file types, counltess issues that can arise. It's a messy field to do biology
in. I've realized that one of the most important skill any person in the field
of genomics must learn is to not trust a single thing. Not a program, or the
data quality or a pipeline. Beacue invariably somethiings going to go wrong,
and the only thing you can do, the best thing you can do, is catch that error
early, as it creeps up. If that error is not caught immedietly, it going to do
one of two thins. 


1. It's going to force you to redo work somewhere farther down the line,
   costing you time and effort that you could have prevented.

or

2. This error will creep its way into your analysis. Causing doubt and
   uncertainty in research that's is already filled with noise and complex
variables. The worst scenario here is you either try to explain an error away
as a biological oddity, and you publish this data. 


It's challenging to constantly be questioning your outpouts. Often time you
just wnat to accept the result of a pipeline and pretesnd that it's correct.
However this is a mistake. One that i've made countless times. So, below is a
list of things that i need to personally do more to ensure that what im doing
doesnt result in one of the two above scenarios.


## Always Check the Output:

No Matter the program something that i alywas atcivly try to do is eye the
output file and ask myself a few questions such as, does this output make sense
and is it the right file type? Is the size something that I would expect? Is
there a way to quality check this file, or oculd i write something to check it
myself?


## Keep better notes than you think you need to 

Inadvertantly when running through a pipeline, the last thing that seems
important at any given moment is the

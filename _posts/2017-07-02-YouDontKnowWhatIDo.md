You don't know what I do. I don't wear a white lab coat, i don't spend my days around beakers or bunsen burners, and i haven't worn proper "lab safe" clothing since i was an undergraduate. I don't work in a lab with chemical, or explosives. Rather I work at a desk plugging away writing code for some of the worlds most powerful computers to run. I spend all day reading and trying to understand math, biology, and computer science and try and find a way that allows all of these fields to work together to allow me to understand how thing change, and how we as things change as well.

Your genome isn't sequecned and assembled by people using microscopes. Heck, if you got your genome sequenced chances are they didn't sequence all of it. Rather the company you sent your DNA to seqeuenced only short segments that are the most "informative", that tell sciensitst the most information with spending the least amount of money to do it. But these little snips of DNA on an inocmplete genome can reveal huge amounts about where you come from and who your ancestors are. It can be a great predictor of diseases we know alot about, but can't tell us anything about more complex traits like why some peoples metabolisms are faster or slower.

You have 20,000 genes in your body (roughly). I can tell you where they generally lie and on what chromosme. I cna tell you their names. But for 60Z% of them i cant tell you what they do. Of the other 40% i might have a general idaa of what they're function is. But how they releate to other genes or even the other 40% we still aren't sure.

We didn't know any of this 17 years ago.

We didn't know half of this 8 years ago.

#I'm not a doctor, and i can't explain every phenomon in your body. i can't tell you why you inherited your mothers weird neck crick or that mole on your left calf that looks exactly like a horse. but i can tell you that a majority of what you are is, is junk dna. you're 90% garbage.

Most biologist nowadays don't venture out into foreign unexplored wildrenesses. Generally they spend more and more time on computers, using the most advanced technoligy we have today to unravel source code that has been under refinment for 3.5 billion years.

I could spend all day telling you about how little we know about genomes. I could spend all day telling you how much we know. But please - keep asking me questions, because i love it. And I want you to know what I do. You don't know anything nad so do I, and that's wonderful.

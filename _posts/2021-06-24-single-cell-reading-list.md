Single cell is a challenging technique to work on. It requires a ton of
expertise in both computational savy, as well as an understanding of some high
level statistics. As such, keeping a list of valuable resources which I've
found useful is a huge boon to all. Here are some readings that I've used to
familiarize myself with different packages/methods/ideas implemented
consistenly. If you have something you think is great feel free to contact me

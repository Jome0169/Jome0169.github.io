So, you've read about it, researched it, looked into what it entails, and you
think bioinformatics might be the field for you. Well, great! It's an amazing
field of science. One undergoing some tremendous growth, and has the potential
to revolutionize the field of biology, medicine, and human health. But... Now
you're left with an issue. Where do you start?

Honestly, this isn't an easy question. Bioinformtics is not a field in which
you can take a single coursera course and be good to go. Rather, bioinformatics
is a massive field where there is a seemingly limitless amount of information
to cram in your very limited brain. 

So, rather than attempt to do the impossible and write an extensive guide to
being a genome wizard, I'm going to instead write a little about some resources
I used to get started,  as well as a little about what you should be
learning from each resource.


##Command Line

If you don't know a thing about computers, this is where you need to start. Not
with learning C, or learning algorithms, but instead learning the basics of
navigating your computer and file system not using a visual interface. 

Many of the programs and much of the software written for bioinformatics is
written to be run on command line. It doesnt have a Graphical user interface
(GUI) like microsoft word or adobe. Rather these programs put all of their
power into doing complicated math and logic, so a friendly user interface
really isn't so much in their cards.

The resource i used starting out was LINK. I would reccomend sections 1-3 I
think it's a great intro into doing basic operations on the command line, as
well as a great way to start getting your head around how file systems operate (hint everything is a tree). 

Everything at some point will come back to command line. Knowing a few good sed
tricks or one liners can save you hours of pain and manual labor.

##Learning to Use Software

So, while much of my day is spent writing my own software and scripts, people
are often times suprised when they find out that much of my day is also spent
running other peoples software and packages. These programs have been made to
work with biological sequence data and are generally known to be timetested (at
least some of them) 

##Start Reading

While this may seem like a trivial mention, I honestly think reading diversly
and deeply in this field might be one of the most under discussed methods. In
order to ascertain how anyone does anything you have to get some kind of
inclination as to what we know, and what we don't know. (In short we know a
ton... but we don't know even more)

## Scripting languages (parsel tounge for begginers)

Alright, now that you might have the basic understaning of how bioinformatics
works, i think it's now important to be able to manipulate raw sequence data.
Being able to write programs to extract certain regions is incredibly important
in field with such a large amount of file type densities. Being able to
reformat files on the fly can make your life much easier, and make you
indespensible.






So, while all these tools are essential for any bioinformatician to learn,
there is one last

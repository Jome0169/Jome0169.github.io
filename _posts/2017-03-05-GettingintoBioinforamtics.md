So, you've read about it, researched it, looked into what it entails, and you
think bioinformatics might be the field for you. Well, great! It's an amazing
field of science. One undergoing some tremendous growth, and has the potential
to revolutionize the field of biology, medicine, and human health. But... Now
you're left with an issue. Where do you start?

Honestly, this isn't an easy question. Bioinformtics is not a field in which
you can take a single coursera course and be good to go. Rather, bioinformatics
is a massive field where there is a seemingly limitless amount of information
to cram in your very limited brain. 

So, rather than attempt to do the impossible and write an extensive guide to
being a genome wizard, I'm going to instead write a little about some resources
I used to get started in the field as well as a little about what you should be
getting from each piece.

Genomics - Bioinformatics - Computational Biology

Three words that to most, mean relativly little. But to this of us
indoctrinated into the field of biology, we know these three terms lie in a
danerous state of contention. 

What I aim to acheice with this blog is create a place where both people new to
the field, and people in the field can gain something. Whether it be a post
explaining the very fundamentals of what computational biology/bioinformatics
is, or a post going into the nitty gritty of how suffix trees are utalized in
BLAST., there will be something for everyone. 


But I am a bioinformatics researcher in love with the intersection of biology
and computers. Where we currently sit is on the precipice where biology stands
to be the next great engineering discipline. We live in remarkable times, and
the way things



#It was once said to me that science today is a teasure trove of riches and
#knowledge the like of which humanity has never seen before, and in Biology,
#this is especially true. For those of us in the field modern Genetics and
#Genomics have changed the way in which we look at the world, as well as
#changing the way we allocate where we stand in the modern world. 
#
#But, sadly, these riches so fast and expansive are unkown to the general
#public. So, in this blog I aim to help people new or curious to the field dive
#in, and dive deep.

As far as I can tell, people reading this blog will experiance it in one of two
ways, so down below make sure to read the section and post that apply to you

1. You haven't taken a biology class since high school, and to you DNA is a
   long distant memory dealing with two old white dudes, and some pea plants.
If that's the case I hope this blog can show you that the world of biology,
genetics, and genomics is far more interesting and accesible than you were
taught to believe. Biology is for everyone, and that includes you.


OR

2. You are a biologist in the field who loves, and breathes all things
   biological. If that is the case - welcome. You will feel right at home. My
specialty is all things genomics and bioinformatics (coding is sweet). A field
that is ever growing and becoming ever more important in biology. So hopefully you
can find somethiong of use. You can find my gith=ub here.

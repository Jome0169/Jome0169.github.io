You're Most likely at this blog for one of two reasons:


You haven't taken a biology class since high school, and to you DNA is a long distant memory dealing with two old white dudes, and some pea plants.
If that's the case I hope this blog can show you that the world of biology,
genetics, and genomics is far more interesting and accesible than you were
taught to believe. Biology is for everyone, and that includes you. 

or...

You're also a bioinforamtician trying to use sofrware that was not meant
for human consumption. In that case, welcome my borthers and sisters! You'll feel right at home. My
focus is on plant geneics/genomics with a dash of computer science thrown in. So hopefully you
can find something of use. You can find me on [github](https://github.com/Jome0169), or follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/pabster212?lang=en).

Feel free to contact me with any thoughts or questions

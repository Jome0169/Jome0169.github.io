If I tell you I am a genomic biologist,
where do you expect I spend most of my time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a lab surrounded by chemicals wearing a white lab coat&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At a desk, on a laptop smack my head against the keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you answered 2, you are correct! But, if you answered 1, don’t worry about
it. I barely understood what genomic biologist did when I was in college
learning this stuff. But it takes many people by suprise when they
initially learn that what I predominitly do with my day is either creating or
running software on my computer to answer biological questions. How did this
happen you might ask? Where are my nerds in white with pipettes and beakers
doing &lt;em&gt;trill&lt;/em&gt; science? Why is this nerd wanting to talk about algorithms with
me? Well, let me tell you a brief story about how we got here (don’t worry,
it’ll be a quick recap, I promise).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, stop me if you’ve heard this story before. For a long time, up until
the mid 1990’s, genomics was an idea reserved for sci-fi novels and speculative
fiction writers. But all of a sudden, something changed. The government decided
to pour a bunch of money into a first of its kind research, the human genome
project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In broad sweeping stroakes, bioinformatics is the filed of using techniques
from computer science to create tools and answer questions regarding biology.
Since almost all sequence data currently created is done so in a digitial
foramt, our only option for manipulating such large amounts of data relies on
the use of computers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary>Alright, I have a question for you. If I tell you I am a genomic biologist,

think bioinformatics might be the field for you. Well, great! It’s an amazing
field of science. One undergoing some tremendous growth, and has the potential
to revolutionize the field of biology, medicine, and human health. But… Now
you’re left with an issue. Where do you start?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, this isn’t an easy question. Bioinformtics is not a field in which
you can take a single coursera course and be good to go. Rather, bioinformatics
is a massive field where there is a seemingly limitless amount of information
to cram in your very limited brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, rather than attempt to do the impossible and write an extensive guide to
being a genome wizard, I’m going to instead write a little about some resources
I used to get started in the field as well as a little about what you should be
getting from each piece.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary>So, you’ve read about it, researched it, looked into what it entails, and you

run correctly. For whatever reason, different perl scripts in different places
don’t seem to run correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’ll need the maker2zff script found in the maker install package located
in the directory /maker/bin/. This script converts your gff3 file of
training genes into a zff file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However you’ll also need a zff.dna file which is simply a fasta file in the
corret order of trainign as produced by SNAP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For this you can use this script below titled fasta_sort.pl which I found
from the Biowize blog https://biowize.wordpress.com/2012/06/01/training-the-snap-ab-initio-gene-predictor/&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running these two scripts will then create your genome.ann and genome.dna files
which will now be used for actually creating a training set in SNAP&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary>In order to run SNAP, you’ll need a few different scripts in order for it to

one I knew had either. While small and unknown, SPALN is useful in genomic
annotaation in its capacity to align various CDS sequences from other species
to your current genome. This comes in and assists tremendously with annotation
later on when running MAKER. So, if well annotataed closely related organisms
are availabe, SPALN is a useful tool that will be worth running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, SPALN is not an easy tool to work with. It comes out of the
university of Kyoto, has a minimalist website, and rather unclear documentation
which you can read
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.genome.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~aln_user/spaln/#Usr&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Below i’ll
detail I install and ran this program. If you’re still unconvinced on the
usefullness of SPALN, I reccomend reading their
&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/40/20/e161/2414522&quot;&gt;publication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;download-and-install-spaln&quot;&gt;Download and Install SPALN&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install SPALN I heavily reccomend using the pre-compiled binaries. Since
there is little to no trouble shooting help, attempting to fix any issue with
compililation can be incredibly tedious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To download and unpack the binaries run&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wget http://www.genome.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~aln_user/archive/spaln2.1.0.linux64.tar.gz
tar xfz spaln2.1.0.linux64.tar.gz
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;spaln -t1 -M4 -Q7 -O0 -LS -ya2 -o ${DBNAME}.spaln.gff3 -d${CutGenome} ${i}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that’s it! Hopefully your SPALN run went well. After this, I would
reccomend editing your SPALN gff3 files in order to reformat them for use with
other software. If you’re looking for a quick way to do this I reccomend my own
gff3 editing code built specifically for SPALN. You can find this code here https://github.com/Jome0169/NoMoreScripting under the “annotation” folder. Simply run the command&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;python3 /data/pabster212/Programs/NoMoreScripting/nomorescripting/annotation/readgff.py -g WM97v1.spaln.gff3 -f1 100 -f2 50000 -spaln -o WM97v1.spaln.clean.gff3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

create a genomic annotation for the Cucubitacea Citroides, a variety of non
sugar forming watermelon in the genus Cucurbitaceae. As someone who reallly
enjoys bioinforamtics I was excited to annotate my first genome. However, the
entire process was foreign and unfamiliar to me, and after reading blog posts
online, the path forward didn’t become any clearer. Without the help of some of
my fantastic lab mates, and resources at BTI, I am unsure I would have been
able to fininish the annotation with anything even close to my sanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gets at the core of why I’m doing this blog series on genomic annotation.
In an age where genomic assemblies are comman place and easy, genomic
annotation remains anything but.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide seaks to guide you through how I do modern genome annotation in 2018.Each step of the annotation will have its own post where I detail what software I ran and the parameters I used to acheive my results. My github code will also be linked if you would like to view/use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;note&quot;&gt;NOTE:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we begin annotation it’s important that you first deducde IF you should
be annotating a genome. The best genome annotations are those which had access
to plentiful data for their organism. At very least, you’ll need a well
assembeled genome with the N50 at LEAST as large as the mean gene size in the
organism. An RNA Seq library is also going to be needed in order to identify
genes that are activly expressed in the genome, giving us a better sense of
what genes are actually real and expressed. Added benefit can also be gained by
having a closely related species with a well annotated genome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a more formal review before you begin your annotation
I would reccomed a few papers https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg3174 and
https://www.nature.com/articles/35080529 are excellent basic primers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lastly, before we start I wanted to impart you with a piece of wisdom from
my indomitable past advisor Nolan Kane. “All Genomes are shit, but some are
useful.” Your annotation will never be perfect, genomics is an imperfect art,
so with that in mind, proceed forward and give it your best. Something you
create just might be useful and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1-repeat-masking&quot;&gt;Step 1 Repeat Masking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repeat masking is an essential step in any genomic annotation. Since many
repetative elements have evolved to be transcribed like a gene, transposbale
elements can throw off genomic annotations a tremendous amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while being important to your annotation, TEs tend to be
the elephant in the room in genomics. People tend to simply run a pipeline such
as repeatmasker and pretend that these results are “good enough”. While these
results might be somewhat useful, they most likely don’t cover a wide enough
range of TE diversity to identify some lineages of TEs that might be unique to
the organism and not within the known libraries of TEs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary>When I initially arrized at the Fei lab at BTI I was given the oppertunity to

Any form of
“Where should I start, and what do i need to learn to get into bioinformatics?”. So, in the hopes of guiding others who are just getting started or interested in getting started, I wanted to write a brief post about how I got started, and what I did to actually learn genomics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide it by no means intensvie. The reality is that genomics is far too
vast and large for me to try and teach yo ueverything you need to know. Rather,
I’ll just be highlighting a few fundamental building blocks that you’ll need to
know to really begin understanding genomics as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;the-very-beggining&quot;&gt;1. The Very Beggining&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you must absolutly learn is command line. Command line is a
simplified method in which you can access and interact with your computer.
Rather than&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I would reccomend that the first thing that anyone getting started need to
learn is command line. In bioinformatics many of the programs that are
utalizied do not have a Graphical User Interfaces (GUI), so instead you must
interact with them on a more basic level of computation, the command line&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn the ins and ours of command line i would reccomend a few places to
start. If you’re technophobic and a little unsure of yourself i would reccomend
Code Academy. Code Academy offers users the oppertunity to beggin learning the
basics of using command lines on a ocmputer without the need to worry if you’re
“messing up” your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;the-actual-programming&quot;&gt;2. The Actual Programming&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While learning the command line is a crucial step in bioinforamtics, learning
to program and script are fundamental and important skills any developing
bioinformatician must learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;getting-to-know-the-greatest-hits&quot;&gt;3. Getting to Know The “Greatest Hits”&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;creating-projects&quot;&gt;4. Creating Projects&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;reading-scienctific-articles&quot;&gt;5. Reading Scienctific Articles&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an aspect of bioinformatics/genomics that I believe is heavily
understated in most “intro” guides. While many such guides instruct you to get
a handle and grasp on programming, far fewer discuss the necessity of reading
everything you possibly can related to the field. With whatever you end up
pursiong there’s no point in redoing work that has been done by a precursor.
Why try and create a genome assembler without knowing the current
methadologies. Reading, and reserach is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I found to be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;continue-to-learn&quot;&gt;6. Continue to Learn&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last point I’ll make in this list is that this list is far from exhaustive.
Bioinforamtics is a massive field that is only getting more complex and
advanced as time goes on. This puts the task of continuoius development
direcltly on the individual. There comes a point where no one can teach you
everything you must learn, so it’s up to you to figure out what you need to
learn, and how to learn it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best people in thie field are those who have a voracious desire to learn
and understand. My advice is to keep trying, and keep advancing. It’s amazing
what consisten effort can yield even if you don’t belive yourself to be gifted&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary>This is a question I see ad nauseam in various online communities. Any form of

If I tell you I am a genomic biologist,
where do you expect I spend most of my time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a lab surrounded by chemicals wearing a white lab coat&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At a desk, on a laptop smacking my head against a keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you answered #2, you’re right! But, if you answered 1, that’s pretty
understandable. Biology has changed more than almost any other branch of
science in the last 20 years. It takes many people by surprise when they learn that I predominantly work on a computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did this happen you might ask? Where are all the Jane Goodalls of the world
sitting in blinds watching chimpanzees? The Darwins traveling through uncharted lands and jungles, collecting new specimens? The
1950’s era scientist in their white lab coats and horn rims? And finally, why
have all of these people been replaced by a nerd wanting to talk to me about
programming languages and algorithms? Well, to understand this evolution and
this paradigm shift, you first need to understand a brief history of about how 
we got here (don’t worry, it’ll be a quick recap, I promise).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, stop me if you’ve heard this story before. DNA was discovered in the
1950’s by two older white men (LINK) who stole some really important data from
a female scientist(LINK). Once it was confirmed that this molecule was the basis of all life, we began trying to understand how it shaped all life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DNA research initially was slow. Scientist at the time were working
with limited tools, and no way of replicating DNA in large quantities.
So, while we knew DNA was the molecule of inheritance, we knew little
about how it actually worked at all. But, for a great recap of the how
we came to learn about how DNA, RNA, and protein came together, check
out these links LINK LINK LINK. They do a far better job than I could
at the moment of explaining some of these early breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1970’s however, a massive breakthrough occurred. Fredrick Sanger(LINK) created a
methodology which allowed for scientist to make lots of DNA at once. But this came with a new problem… How do I analyze all of these new DNA copies? How do I
compare my DNA to the DNA of a tree, or a chimp? Well, initially to
understand the contents of DNA, to get down to the level of A’s, T’s,
G’s, and C’s you had to do quite a bit of chemistry, and then analyze
something like this…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PICTURE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the above photo makes very little sense to you, don’t worry. These types of photos hardly make sense to anyone anymore. Quickly, people realized that the above method of comparison was inefficient and limiting. If it was challenging comparing two slightly different pieces od DNA, comparing a genomes worth, 3.1 billion nucleotides, would be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on we had some idea of how much DNA is in a human cell using flow cytomatry, and we established that it was probably arounda  few billion base pairs. So if it took weeks or months to get the sequence of a strand of DNA that was 500 base pairs long, the idea of sequencing all of the DNA of an organisms seemed like a pipe dream. )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in comes our heroin, a scientist by the name of Margaret Dayhoff. Dayhoff did something that changed science and biology forever. She created a computer program to help us read and analyze biological data. And thus, the field of bioinformatics was born. Not out of a random act, but out of neccesity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While all this work was being done, the idea of genomics in the mid 1990’s, was still an idea reserved for sci-fi novels and speculative fiction writers. The idea of sequencing the whole of an organisms DNA still far off. But all of a sudden, something changed. The government decided to pour a bunch of money into a first of its kind research, the human genome project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, bioinformatics was born. Not out of a happy coincidence. But by
a group of men and women well aware that to tackle this problem. To
understand who we are and what we are, we needed to utilize every tool
available to us. And it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I begin I just want to make one thing very clear. Bioinformatics is a
huge field. At the time I am writing this, it is a tool and skill set being
used in almost every realm of biology. From Cellular biology, all the way up to
developmental biology. It’s everywhere. And the tools that one computational
biologist uses might be totally different than another. )&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary>Alright, I have a question for you. If I tell you I am a genomic biologist,
where do you expect I spend most of my time?</summary></entry></feed>

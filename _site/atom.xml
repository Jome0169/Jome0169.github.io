reserach. These proteins which recognize, and recruit various complexes and
proteins to post tranlational modification (PTMs) cause many of the correlated
effects of we recognize in epigenomic research. For example, when methylation
is added to a lysine on the alpha globulin tail of a histone (K36 in this
instance), this methylation has no direct effect on
altering the chromatin like acetylation does. Rather it affects transcription
by recruiting a series of readers which in turn recruit more factors. And so
the chromatin cylcle of influcence continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An essential mark I use to identify novel transcription regions in monocots is
H3K36me3. So in turn, I wanted to read a paper getting into the identification
of a reader enzyme for this specific mark. Enter Jin et al, 2015, “MORF-RELATED
GENE702, a Reader Protein of Trimethylated Histone H3 Lysine 4 and Histone H3
Lysine 36, Is Involved in Brassinosteroid-Regulated Growth and Flowering Time
Control in Rice”. A paper diving into this very question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic set-up of this paper is this group had previously identifed two
proteins in Arabidopsis that recognize H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, namely
MORF RELATED GENE (MRG) 1 &amp;amp; 2 via their chromodomains, and a series of
functional studies. Therefor, this group was curious how MRG would operate in
monocots since it had only been tested in dicots. So, they chose to investigate
this proteins function in rice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;experiments&quot;&gt;Experiments&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This group initially tested the expression of MRG702 and MRG 701, ortholgs of
the Arabidposis version. Found that MRG 702 was the more up-regulated version,
and used this as evidence to call it the more important functional copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They they generated knock-down version of 702, and both 701 and 702. They
discovered that the knockdown of 702 had an almost identical phenotype to
knocking out both, allowing the scientist to conclude that 702 is the more
important protein here as the phenotype wasn’t exacterbated at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say, the knockdown phenotypes look pretty good! They also had a smart
decision here where they also knocked down the histone methyltransferase
responsible for laying down H3K36me3. This allowed the authors to compare
knockouts putativly in similar pathways. Interestingly similar phenotypes were
found, pointing to the fact that these are more than likely operating in the
same genetic pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Jin_et_al_2015_imgs/Jin_plants.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pretty Plants!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figures #2 and #3 basically get at the phenotypes of these knockouts, and while
they look somewhat striking, they rely on a few test of Brassinosteroid
sensing, and flowering time that I don’t like very much. For first their
assays, while I’m sure valuable, are incredibly domain specific, and make me
question how valuable they really are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I have an issue with this studies repeated use of RT-PCR at a few
select loci. When measuring complex phenotypes, they attempt to use previous
literature to select loci that they beleive should have signifigantly different
expression from their knockouts. While this appears to be true, I would have
preffered if this lab had done RNA seq to look at a more global level of
transcription. Since this reader is more than likely not targeted to this
single pathway, I would have found it more convincing if they had demonstrated
this on a global level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure #4 is in my opinion the second key figure of this entire paper. It
illustrates that in a dot blot assay link:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_blot (a varient of western where you basically
don’t get size information), you find specific binding of MRG702 for H3K36me3,
and both H3K4me2 and H3K4me3. Basically, big poing MRG702 has histone
specificity!!! Woo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Jin_et_al_2015_imgs/Jin_dot_blot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dot Plot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the authors do ChIP, and demonstrate that MRG702 binding acts on
H3K36me3, and use a 725Ri-i mutant (SDG8 mutant) to demonstrate the MRG702
binds to known loci whith H3K36me3 deposited, and that in the abscence of this
methylation (mutatnt), you no longer MRG binding. Pretty neat!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Jin_et_al_2015_imgs/Jin_chip.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chip&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solid paper overall that I believe did a decent job identifying a reader of
H3K36me3 in Oryza sativa. I still wish the authors didn’t use rt-PCRl, and
instead had done RNA-seq as well as ChIP-seq. But I recognize I have some
intense genomic bias in this.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary>Understanding the landscape of histone readers is of crucial importance to my

Some are good, some are bad, and some are
really - really important. So, here is a collection of papers that I think are
important, and one or two reasons why I think so. This is going to be broken
down loosely by subject matter, and will be updated as I go along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enhancers&quot;&gt;Enhancers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;genetic-dissection-of-the--alpha-globin-super-enhancer-in-vivo&quot;&gt;Genetic dissection of the  alpha-globin super-enhancer in vivo&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3605&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; by Hay et al is an
excellent read. Often times in genomics we describe phenomena wich we believe
have strong biological implications. The discovery and calssifications of super
enhancers being one such instance. This paper does a great job in going into a
system (mouse) and test the hypothesis that enhancers have emergent qualities. 
So - if you and all your enhancer buddies are hanging out - do you get stronger,much like Bros lifting in a gym? The answer appears to be… No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather you have an additive effect between enhancers. So, nothing super special.Really calls into question some of the rhetoric that has been deployed around these pieces of the genome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other great takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enhancer Assys don’t always line up with genomic prediction. Three reported enhancers appear to have no reporting capability in vivo (granted this might be due to poor reporting assays, or local chromatin envriorments)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Super” enhancers appear to offer quite a bit of backup capabilities. Delete one - or two (Figure 4 B/C) and you may not see any change, or any &lt;strong&gt;signifigant&lt;/strong&gt; change in phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Looping doesn’t seem to be altered by deletion of the strongest enhancers. For whatever reason topological assocations appear to be tough as nails&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enhancer Accessible chromatin formation is NOT dependent on other Enhancers. So if you delete the big Kahuna - all the other enhancers form just fine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key-Figure: 4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;looping&quot;&gt;Looping&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;functional-dissection-of-the-sox9kcnj2-locus-identifies-nonessential-and-instructive-roles-of-tad-architecture-despand-etal-2019&quot;&gt;Functional dissection of the Sox9–Kcnj2 locus identifies nonessential and instructive roles of TAD architecture, Despand Et.al (2019)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loops are a weird and wild place. If you keep up with gene regulation
literature at all you’ll know they’re kinda the ‘hot’ ticket item recently for
research. With some claiming that loops are an essential, and massive component
of gene regulation due to their capactiy of linking up genes with their
cognate enhancers, while others argue that they really don’t do as much as we
perceive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basic model of loop extrusion model (this is going to be displayed as an image
because I could write a blog post about the intricacies of how this works)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/loop_model.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-0466-z&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; by Despang et
al seeks to answer these questions by functionally dissecting, altering and
rearaging the TADs around the sox-9 kcnj2 locus. This is an excellent choice
considering that both of these genes generate striking phenotypes in mouse
development. Paired with this is the advantage that this loci is relatively 
enhancer rich, allowing the authors to get at one outstanding question in
looping-enhancer biology. Mainly - do loops dictate enhancer gene expression,
thus altering gene expression?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main Take Aways: 
+ CTCF sites and TAD substructure, PAIRED with TAD boundry are
what mediate TADs
+ Fusing of TADs has no large change on gene expression or phenotype. So…
Enhancers appear to be able to find their cognate gene without speicially
defined TADs (You’ll just have to take the authors word here that this is
happening. Mainly point to phenotype of this last conclustion)
+ Inversions don’t alter TADs UNLESS the inversion also contains the TAD
boundries (Figure 4b/c). However- kcnj2 DOES have increased contacts with the
enhancer elements and does exhibit increased gene expression
+ Of the structural re-aragnmetns they caused gain of function mutations. With
expression of kcnj2. IN the inversion contining the TAD boundries, kcnj2
actually took up the phenotype of sox9 (wild). This gain of function patter
wast still seen just with the fusuion of the TAD boundries, here incDeltaBOR
(Figure 5c)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other great takeaways: 
+ Fusing TADs doesn’t really seem to matter too much which is intersting.
+ The authors point to phase separation as a possible mechanism of how enhancers
are still accessing their cognate gene. Will phase separation be the next
looping? Time will tell! (yes it will)
+ Excellent figures imo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Figures: 2-5 tbh. Hugely important paper that’s really worth getting into&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lncrnas&quot;&gt;lncRNAs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;noncoding-transcription-by-alternative-rna-polymerases-dynamically-regulates-an-auxin-driven-chromatin-loop-2014&quot;&gt;Noncoding Transcription by Alternative RNA Polymerases Dynamically Regulates an Auxin-Driven Chromatin Loop (2014)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25018019&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; is an interesting
one because it’s really one of the first paper to find an lncRNA in
arabidopsis, delete it, and show a phenotypic effect. This alone makes it a
fairly important piece of plant genomics literature in my opinion. Authors on
this guy are Ariel et al, with crespi being the senior investigator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But diving into this paper, this paper seeks to demonstrate the link that an
identified lncRNA by the name of APOLO regulates PINOID (PID), a well known gene in root development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to takcle this the authors generated a system to interfere with APOLO using
RnaI techniques. Upon knocking down APOLO transcription, PID was knocked down
as well, and generated longer roots as a byproduct - Figures 1 B-D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, the authros attempt to demonstrate that the epigenetic landscape of APOLO and PID
dynamically change in response to AUXIN treatment. I find this section (Figure
2) fairly poorly explained, and hard to interpret. Their ChIP-qPCR graphs
strike me as being nearly indecipherable. That being said they take this study
in an intersting direction as they attempt to elucidate how APOLO is being
transcribed. They know from mutants like nrpd2a (pol IV subunit)
that APOLO was still transcribed meaning it’s most likely transcribed by POL II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this paper however, I do have some issues. I think Figure 2 is nearly
illegible here. It’s challenging to understand, and the trends to authors point
to are rather opaque. Secondly, the mechanism which they draw upon is quite
complex, making me wonder well… Is it really that complex? Or have they
heaped on a complex mechanism in an attempt to explain this. Added on top of
this is recent research in the plant field pointing to the idea that
methylation may not be the end all be all of gene silencing, esecially
considering that some gene body nethylated genes are heavily transcribed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other issues - ChIP-qpcr in 2014 to me seems really… Questionable. Why not do
ChIP-seq? There’s no need, and it would have made many of their figures far
more convincing in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main Takaways:
+ There are lncRNAs in the arabidopsis genome that have phenotypes. I’ve had
  more than a few poeple ask me if such a thing exist so that’s great to have
+ They can be possibly transcribed by different POLs either POL II or POL IV. 
+ They appear (possibly) to have a capacity to regulat the epigenetic
  landscape in regards to recruiting PCRC1/2 (not sure I buy this. Other review
  have said this point is overblow in mammals)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Figures: 1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;unlinking-an-lncrna-from-its-associated-cis-element-2016&quot;&gt;Unlinking an lncRNA from Its Associated cis Element (2016)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like this paper overall. I think it does an excellent job of
displaying a somewhat novel mechanism of lncRNAs. It’s short, sweet, to the
point, and does the exact exerpiments you want them to do. Anyways, to the
paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27041223&quot;&gt;Parakallar et al&lt;/a&gt;
basically ask the question, “does the lncRNA matter” compared to the sequence
underneath it? It does so by looking at the lncRNA Lockd and the gene Cdkn1b.
The authors start off by demonstrating that if you delete the lncRNA Lockd
using cirps/cas9, the gene product is reduced (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you simply add a polyadenalation signal to the middle of exon 1 of
the lncRNA, the lncRNA product is reduce, but the gene product remains almost
unchanged. Demonstarting that the lncRNA product itself isn’t important, but
the loci is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted though, that this doesn’t mean that the lncRNA product
itself is TOTALLY useless. Rather, it’s useless to it’s closest gene. The
authors didn’t explore the possability that Lockd was acting in Trans in any
way. Granted, most of the known lncRNAs (xist mainly) appear to act in a
neighborhood esque manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other Takeaways:
+ Man, I’m so envious how easy it is to generate knockouts in cell lines. Seems
  like you’re so unrestrained in some systems (yay plants!)
+ Excellent concise review of other mechanisms found in the lncRNA literature,
  and some other things to brush up on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Figure: 2B&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;transcription&quot;&gt;Transcription&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stochastic-mrna-synthesis-in-mammalian-cells-2006&quot;&gt;Stochastic mRNA Synthesis in Mammalian Cells (2006)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper by Raj et al is a pretty sweet study that really began our
understanding of the ‘burst’ dynamics of transcription, and man oh man it’s
cool. Often times I feel as if the term ‘elegent’ is overused when describing
papers, but this one, this one is certainly elegant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors initiated this study by wanting to study transcription in vivo. To
do so they develope this awesome system where thye basically create an reporter gene
with a ton of binding sites for florescent probes. When expressed and annealed,
these probes are able to pinpoint single molecules in the cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After demonstrating that this ‘works’ the authors then go on to describe where
mRNA localizes. Their big point is that when you see these lit up regions of
transcription you generally see more mRNA in the nucleus, and when you don’t
see these transcriptionally active points you tend to find more mRNA in the
cytoplasm, Figure 2D. They also make a point that in 2D these two cells while
having vastly different localization of mRNA also appear to be delinated from
the same parent cell, indicating that mRNA variation is not simply due to
differences in cell cycle stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, the authors modify their reporter gene with either one or seven copies of
totO, a reporter that you’re able to shut off in the prescence of Doxycycline.
Doxycline minimizes the required holodimer tTA required to drive transcription.
Bascially they found that increasing the amount of doxycline reduces the amont
of mRNA of the gene, but the NOISE, here defined as (standard deviation/mean )
did NOT change. They chock this up to being reflective of the thing that really
matters is the activation state of the gene itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then go on to show that increasing the number of TF factors that bind OR
increasing the number of transcription factor sites increases the size of the
burst. This paper goes on pionting out that it appears genes that genes being
turned on is intrinsically random.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main Takeways:
+ Transcription happens in burst, the size of these burst are modulated by thing liks Transcription factor binding and such
+ The pinpoint chromatin as a likely cause of which changes genes from
being ‘on’ or ‘off’ pointint to the idea that the rate limiting step of
transcription is most likely chromatin decondensation.
+ Give these results there are most likely two ways in which transcription
is able to increase - (ii) increase the rate of transcription when the gene
is in the active state, or (iii) decrease the rate of gene inactivation
(the opposite behaviors, of course, apply should a cell decide to
downregulate a gene’s transcription)&lt;/p&gt;

If
for instance you have overlapping genes, or very closely nested genes, you wont
be able to accuretly calculate transcription units unless you know the strand
of origin of both your RNA library and your genes
of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to identify the strand orientation of RNA NGS libraries I
downloaded from SRA I stumpbled upon this excellent little tool called
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;infer_experiment.py&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rseqc.sourceforge.net&quot;&gt;RseqC&lt;/a&gt;. It’s
a great resource for this kind of thing. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;infer_experiment.py&lt;/code&gt; takes in a bam
file (aligned to your genome) and a BED file of genes with known strandedness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So - to run it in parallel on all my bam libraries I just did a simple
parallel command to expedite it as it’s quite quick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;parallel -j 2 &quot;infer_experiment.py -r Zea_mays.AGPv4.36.gene_only_strand.bed -i {} &amp;gt; library_type_id_{/.}.txt&quot; ::: ../all_aligned_files_sorted/*.bam
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this runs, the output looks like 
```
This is PairEnd Data
Fraction of reads failed to determine: 0.0067
Fraction of reads explained by “1++,1–,2+-,2-+”: 0.4973
Fraction of reads explained by “1+-,1-+,2++,2–”: 0.4960&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is PairEnd Data
Fraction of reads failed to determine: 0.0104
Fraction of reads explained by “1++,1–,2+-,2-+”: 0.5001
Fraction of reads explained by “1+-,1-+,2++,2–”: 0.4895
```&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what this output is telling you is that the reads are coming from either
hte posotive or negative strand, and do NOT agree with the strandedness of the
genes they’re aligning to. So this is an UNSTRANDED library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plotTracks(c(axisTrack,grtrack, leaf_H3K36me3_ranges_4, leaf_H4K4me1_ranges_4,
rna_Seq_data_ranges_4), from=10633266, to=10643235, chromosome=&#39;4&#39;, type=&quot;h&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the output looking like:
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/gviz_cow/P1.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can catch this image using  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;grid::grid.grabExpr()&lt;/code&gt; which saves your output as a glob image for later proccessing. So if you’re planning on outputting it to cowplot/combining it with another plot you can do something like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p1 &amp;lt;- grid::grid.grabExpr(plotTracks(c(axisTrack,grtrack,
leaf_H3K36me3_ranges_4, leaf_H4K4me1_ranges_4, rna_Seq_data_ranges_4),
from=10633266, to=10643235, chromosome=&#39;4&#39;, type=&quot;h&quot;),wrap.grobs = TRUE)


p2 &amp;lt;- grid::grid.grabExpr(plotTracks(c(axisTrack,grtrack,leaf_H3K36me3_ranges_2,
leaf_H4K4me1_ranges_2, rna_Seq_data_ranges_2), from=198700931, to=198710900,
chromosome=&#39;2&#39;, type=&quot;h&quot;),wrap.grobs = TRUE)

final_figure_1A_plot &amp;lt;- gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=2) 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we’ve combined our two plots, it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/gviz_cow/P1_P2.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, we take the ‘final’ plot from Figure 1A, and then plot it with the
other figures using plot grid using the code below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;#Generate Empty plot for Examples
empty_plot &amp;lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) 

final_everything &amp;lt;- plot_grid(final_figure_1A_plot, OTHER_FIGURE, labels = c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;&quot;), nrow = 2, ncol = 1, rel_heights = c(1, 1.5))
final_everything

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which then makes:
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/gviz_cow/Final.png&quot; alt=&quot;Final&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which will allow you to smack you GVIZ object with other graphs. This little
work around single handedly allowed me to avoid illustrator all together! yippie!&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary>If you’re trying to use both Gviz and cowplot in the same package it can be
done. It took me a while, but I eventually found the answer on a combination of
a github page/as well as what I presume to be a chinese version of github. So
for example - lets say you’re generating the following Gviz image with the

Whether it be a different IDE, different libraries, everyone has a set up that is uniqly their own. In an attempt to distill my
knowledge to those who might be interested, I thought I’d
write a quick post detailing some components of my workflow that I couldn’t
live without.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;idestext-editors&quot;&gt;IDEs/Text Editors:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vim&quot;&gt;VIM&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know me, this won’t surprise you. I’m an avid VIM user. I find its
‘lightweightness’ as well as its universal occurrence on servers essential. Need to open a massive 4Gb file in it? Sure! It
won’t be pretty, but god damn does it work. Need to make a quick edit to that
script you just copied over? Easy Peazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paired with its massive archive of plugins makes it an amazing editor that
can do anything sublime2 or visualstudio code can. It’s also a text editor that I find consistently rewards you for 
sticking with it. If you find yourself coding along, consistenly hitting the
same “Pain point”, the VIM community has come up with a macro combination to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rstudio&quot;&gt;RStudio&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use R, you know what this is and why you need it. It makes writing R
scripts joyous, logically displays your environment, and makes graphing/ 
dealing with packages easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;command-line-accessories&quot;&gt;Command Line ‘Accessories’&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tmux&quot;&gt;TMUX&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, between TMUX and VIM, I’m not sure which has had a larger
effect on my workflow. At this point both are completely indispensable to me,
albeit for different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TMUX is a terminal multiplexer. It allows users to split their singular
terminal session into multiple, allowing you login once, and then have a pane
dedicated to writing bash scripts, copying over data, etc…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sold? It ALSO doesn’t log off much like &lt;strong&gt;screen&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning you can open up
3-4 windows, run separate commands, detach the session, and come back later.
This has so so so many added benefits. Hit the wrong hot key and close your
terminal window? YOUR WORK IS STILL THERE!!!. Honestly, I can’t praise TMUX
highly enough. It’s infinite customizability, and integration with VIM
transforms both these softwares into an amazing IDE that can be accessed on any
remote server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a computational biologists dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fd-like-find-but-i-can-remember-the-command&quot;&gt;fd (like find, but I can remember the command)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding files is a pain in the ass with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; command. For whatever reason
I can never seem to remember the inane synatx&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conda&quot;&gt;CONDA&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is possibly my most recent addition to my workflow as of late. But my GOD,
I don’t know how I ever lived without it before. Conda is a container workflow
that allows a user to generate a specific enviornment to run their software. So
if you’re having issue getting all of your python library installs to work
across different clusters, conda is a god send. Its actually hard to imagine
just how much time it has saved me overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;libraries&quot;&gt;Libraries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pybedtoolspysamtools&quot;&gt;pybedtools/pysamtools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibly the best python libraries I’ve ever used. Well documented, fast,
excellent usage scenarios. It’s saved me countless hours, and allowed me to
break up the standard worflow of “Data -&amp;gt; Command Line App -&amp;gt; python 
-&amp;gt; output” to just “Data -&amp;gt; python -&amp;gt; output”, allowing me to avoid a full
step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paired with the fact that these libraries are very well tested, and have
some pretty sophisticated communities around them allow me to relax just a bit
more, and focus on my science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tidyverse&quot;&gt;Tidyverse&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dislike the R programming language. I think it’s poorly written, and
needlessly complex. It’s the perl of statistics in so many ways. The Tidyverse
basically makes R usable. If you’re not using it I weep for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonus&quot;&gt;Bonus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rhodia-sketch-pad&quot;&gt;Rhodia Sketch pad&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, sometimes you just desperatly need to sketch out your ideas. I’m a
massive believer that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;r-for-data-analysis&quot;&gt;R for data analysis&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still suck at R for the most part. So this free E-book for me has been an
absolute godsend.&lt;/p&gt;

stumbeled into a rather irritating probelm. I kept getting the classic message
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Segmentation fault (core dumped)&lt;/code&gt;. Upon looking around for the solution to
this problem I found nothing. So I thought I would document briefly what I did
to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

Segmentation fault (core dumped)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon investigating this further, I decided to see if the issue was coming from the scaffold reported in the error, B73V4_ctg162. To see check this I first analysed how many reads were aligning to this contig in the maize genome using  using a quick samtools command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;#Command:
samtools idxstats chip_B73_ear_H3K36me3_rep1_bowtie2algn.sorted.bam | grep B73V4_ctg162

#Output:
B73V4_ctg162    40634   0       0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, there were ZERO reads aligning to this contig. Making me think the software might be chocking on this scaffold. But after removing this scaffold from the SAM file, I was still being greated by &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Segmentation fault (core dumped)&lt;/code&gt; . So, in order to try again I took a more drastic measure removed all scaffolds that had CTG in them. I did this after checking the gff3 file for all scaffolds/contigs, and coming to the conclusion that none of them are particularly gene rich and/or interesting for my questions. I removed ALL of these scaffolds using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;grep -v &quot;B73V4_ctg*&quot; chip_rep1_bowtie2algn.sam  &amp;gt; chip_rep1_bowtie2algn.noctg_scaff.sam &amp;amp;&amp;amp; grep -v &quot;B73V4_ctg*&quot; chip_rep1_bowtie2algn.sam  &amp;gt; chip_rep1_bowtie2algn.noctg_scaff.sam 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventuall re-ran this software using these generated SAM (I didn’t want to take the extra step of going from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;samtools view | grep _v &lt;/code&gt; back to sam) files, and was eventually rewarded with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success! It appears that those nasty scaffolds/contigs were proving to be quite troublesome for this software. But, this isn’t an ideal solution. We’re still casting out genomic information that I would prefer to keep for analysis. So… There has to be a smarter way of doing this. Maybe pin pointing the exact scaffolds that were failing and why?

It has many variants, but the
most frequent I see goes something like - “Where should I start, and what do I need to learn to get into bioinformatics/genomics?”. So, in the hopes of providing decent answer to those just getting started in the field, I wanted to write a brief post with the hopes of pointing you in the right direction. This guide it by no means intensive introduction to the field, nor is it meant to be. The reality is that bioinformatics as a field is far too vast and large for me to try and  describe everything you will need to learn. Rather, I’ll just be highlighting a few powerful building blocks that’ll get you started quicklky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One point I want to make clear before we begin, is that this blog post is
written for those who have biological questions they want to ANSWER using
computation and computer science. This is wholly different from the valuable 
group of biologist pursuing method development (creating software). While many of the skills
overlap, I can’t appreciably write a guide from this perspective as it’s not
my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone who is a biologist who wants to answer biological questions qill have a
very different avenue of learning than someone who is trying to create tools
for biologist to learn. But alas, the roadmap waits…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;the-very-beginning&quot;&gt;1. The Very Beginning&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you must learn is command line. It’s the cornerstone of
learning to interact with data on your computer, and learning that you can
divorce yourself from programs such as EXcel and be totally fine. You can thinkg og command line as a simplified and stripped back method in which you can access and interact with your computer. Instead of using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface&quot;&gt;graphical user interface&lt;/a&gt;(GUI for short), you’ll be working with your computer on a more basal level of only text commands. While this may appear intimidating at first, the pay offs of learning it thoroughly have massive returns on your productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn the ins and outs of command line there are two places I would
recommend starting. If you’re technophobic and a little unsure of yourself i would recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjLgLKUia_fAhUln-AKHepWA58QFjAAegQIAxAC&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.codecademy.com%2Flearn%2Flearn-the-command-line&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2W4SXDZOVLJGgMMuEIe6j-&quot;&gt;Code Academys command line course&lt;/a&gt;. Code Academy offers users the opprotunity to begin learning the basics of using command lines on a computer without the need to worry about “messing up” your computer. However, while this might seem great, at some point you will have to pivot to actually using command line on your personal system. For this, I think the best turtorial I have found is http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/ Basic
commands and excercises. Worth your time. It covers the very fundamentals much
like code academy, but makes the transition to your own machine easy and
intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main resons I tell people to start here is that most bioinformatics software is not created to be run with a GUI. The designers
of said softwares are far more focused on results rather than creating a
simplified programming interface. So if you’re interested in actually
assembling your genome, or transcriptome, or calling peaks, or ANYTHING -
you’ll have to use command line.Being proficient in it is of massive importance. I would go so far as to say that if you can’t use the command line, you can’t do bioinformatics on any discernible level. And while there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geneious.com/&quot;&gt;companies&lt;/a&gt; attempting to mitigate the need for command line interfaces, these tools are severluy under powered, and slow in comparison to doing it to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;the-actual-programming&quot;&gt;2. The Actual Programming&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While learning the command line is a crucial step in bioinforamtics, learning
to program and script are fundamental and important skills any developing
bioinformatician must learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often times the output from software isn’t exactly what you want. Or it simply
won’t be imputed very easily due to the nature of the file format. But then
you’re left with an issue. How do you parse a 3GB file and remove the
information you want? You might be able to do it on command line using a combo
of awk, and or grep, but what if the operations you’re performing are very
complex?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best solution to this issue is to begin teaching yourself ‘scripting’. Scripting can basically be thought of as writing small pieces of code that can help you impute different types of data to a more reasonable format. At a basic level if can make working with text files a much easier affair, and at a higher level it opens up avenues for publishing bioinforamtics software for others to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I want to mention is that if you’re just getting into scripting, the
distance between writing your first for loop, and solving your first
bioinformatics task can be quite large. With this space irritation can easily
creep in and frusturate first time learners. That’s why I always reccomend
people attempt to apply the skill they’re learning as quickly as they can, to
begin to give them direction and an a basic understanding of use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first scripting can seem like and inconquerable task. It can seem like the
difference between someo one who is fluent in a langauge and yourself is
massive. But like anything else, it’s simply a matter of taking your time, and
practicing. Writing scripts that are always a little bit outside of what you’re
capabale of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, enough motivation, and on to the resources. First and formost, learn
python, and Python 3 at that. Any other langauge is simply archaic, and not
worth your time (come at me perl boys). To learn python, the most effective
tools I used were two fold - &lt;a href=&quot;https://learnpythonthehardway.org/&quot;&gt;Learn python the hard
way&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python&quot;&gt;code academy 
intro to python course&lt;/a&gt;. Both offer the basics of the language and syntax
and put you on the fast path to learning a language. Make sure you’re focusing
on questions such as “how could I use this data type in my own questions?
Should i put this fasta file into a string, or a dictionary, and what are the
benefits?””&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for immediate practice as well, check our
http://rosalind.info . Rosalind is an awesome sight named after one of the
discoverers of DNA (Rosalind Franklin), and offers some excellent practice
problems that allow you to pivot your basic python understanding to solving
basic bioinformatics task. These probelms scale quickly, so be ready for a
challenge!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;getting-to-know-the-greatest-hits&quot;&gt;3. Getting to Know The “Greatest Hits”&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time and time again in this field you will most likely find yourself reaching
for the same slew of tools. Tools that are so central to the analysis and usage
of next generation sequencing (NGS) data that you’ll find yourself using them
consistenly. A brief list of tools that I find myself using on the regular are
tools such as&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;SAMTOOLS
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Alignment software for aligning whole genome shotgun (WGS) reads from an experiment to a reference genome. This is an essential step in almost all
analysis in bioinformatics&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;BLAST
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;BLAST is a pariwise alignment tool that lets you align two sequences
  together that you wish to compare. Lets say you want to compare two genes
from the same family and see how “similar” they are? Blast can get the job done&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;BEDTools
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Can be thought of as the cousin to samtools. Operates on slightly
different data types, but the usage remains the same. How do I find where
certain genes intersect with my reference genome? How do I know how many reads
cover a certain regions?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list is by no means exhaustive, nor is it really even close to being so.
The tools you end up using will be very specific to your own questions and
emthods you are pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my last note on this. Don’t worry about memorizing the manuals for any of
these tools. What I always say is the first time you use a tool, read the
manual all the way through ONCE - so you have an idea of what it can and cannot
do. After this, make sure you’re using the right tool for the job. Find a
review where it is compared to other known tools, and ensure that its
performance is at least in the ballpark of usability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for the best guide I have found on using these tools I would
reccomend XXXXX qebstei. A phenomenal blog post that seeks to teach you the
basics of some of these aplpliocations with the real tool sets you’ll be using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;reading-scienctific-articles&quot;&gt;4. Reading Scienctific Articles&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an aspect of bioinformatics/genomics that I believe is heavily
understated in most “intro” guides. While many such guides instruct you to get
a handle and grasp on programming, far fewer discuss the necessity of reading
everything you possibly can related to the field. With whatever you end up
pursiong there’s no point in redoing work that has been done by a precursor.
Why try and create a genome assembler without knowing the current
methods? Reading, and reserach is crucial. Don’t reinvent the wheel and expect
to be hailed as the genius in the field. Rather, use the wheel to get somewhere
you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I have found to be consistenly true in bioiformatics, and ascience as
a whole is that those who read ask the better questions, allowing them to publish research that we all actually want to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s east to cruise on your programming in this field. It’s easy to be the guy
in the lab people need to write python scripts. But if you want to be a
scientist and not just someones code moneky you HAVE to, and I mean HAVE to
read widly and deeply in the field. It will make you great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;continuing-to-learn&quot;&gt;5. Continuing to learn&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last point I’ll make in this list is that this list is far from exhaustive
in what you’ll need to do learn to ‘be a bioinforamtician’.
Bioinforamtics is a massive field that is only getting more complex and
advanced as time goes on. This puts the task of continuoius development
direcltly on the individual. There comes a point where no one can teach you
everything you must learn, so it’s up to you to figure out what you need to
learn, and how to learn it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best people in thie field are those who have a voracious desire to learn
and understand. My advice is to keep trying, and keep advancing. It’s amazing
what consisten effort can yield even if you don’t belive yourself to be ‘gifted’. Just enjoy the process, and don’t be afraid to mess up and get your hands dirty. Learning is all about making mistakes. So who really cares if you ruin a Fasta file because of a bad carrot command as long as you have backups?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bioinformatics rewards Do-ers, so make sure you are one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Pablo&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary>This is a question I see all the time online. It has many variants, but the
most frequent I see goes something like - “Where should I start, and what do I need to learn to get into bioinformatics/genomics?”. So, in the hopes of providing decent answer to those just getting started in the field, I wanted to write a brief post with the hopes of pointing you in the right direction. This guide it by no means intensive introduction to the field, nor is it meant to be. The reality is that bioinformatics as a field is far too vast and large for me to try and  describe everything you will need to learn. Rather, I’ll just be highlighting a few powerful building blocks that’ll get you started quicklky.</summary></entry></feed>

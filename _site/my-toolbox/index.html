<p>It seems like everyone who does computational biology has a different workflow.
Whether it be a different IDE, or a host of different libraries, everyone seems
to have a set up that is uniqly their own. In an attempt to distill my minimal

write a quick post detailing some components of my workflow that I couldn’t
live without.</p>

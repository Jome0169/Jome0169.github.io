<p>Before entering the Fei Lab I had never head of SPALN, and quite frankly, no
one I knew had either. While small and unknown however, SPALN is userful in
genomic annotaation in its capacity to align various CDS sequences from other
species to your current genome. This comes in and assists tremendously with
annotation later on when running MAKER. So, if well annotataed closely related
organisms are availabe, SPALN is a useful tool that will be worth running.</p>

<p>That being said, SPALN is not an easy tool to work with. It comes out of the
university of Kyoto, has a minimalist website, and rather unclear
documentation. http://www.genome.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~aln_user/spaln/#Usr 
Below i’ll detail a little further how I installed and ran this program. If
you’re still unconvinced on the usefullness of SPALN, I reccomend reading about
it <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/40/20/e161/2414522">here</a></p>

<h3 id="download-and-install-spaln">Download and Install SPALN</h3>

<p>To downlaod SPALN and begin the installation process simply run the commands
below</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>wget http://www.genome.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~aln_user/archive/spaln2.1.0.tar.gz

tar xvf spaln2.1.0.tar.gz
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>After unzipping and uncompressing the tar-ball, change directoy to <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd ./spalnXX/src</code> and run <code class="highlighter-rouge">./configure</code> a message should appear that looks like…</p>

	<figcaption>You know it's going to be a rough install when the auther
wishes you "good luck".</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Then type <code class="highlighter-rouge">make</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">make install</code> and hope for the best.</p>

<p>So, that’s it! Hopefully your SPALN run went well. After this, I would
reccomend editing your SPALN gff3 files in order to reformat them for use with
other software. If you’re looking for a quick way to do this I reccomend my own
gff3 editing code built specifically for SPALN. You can find this code here https://github.com/Jome0169/NoMoreScripting under the “annotation” folder. Simply run the command</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>python3 /data/pabster212/Programs/NoMoreScripting/nomorescripting/annotation/readgff.py -g WM97v1.spaln.gff3 -f1 100 -f2 50000 -spaln -o WM97v1.spaln.clean.gff3
</code></pre>
</div>

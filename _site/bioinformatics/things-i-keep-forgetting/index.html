in. I’ve realized that one of the most important skill any person in the field
of genomics must learn is to not trust a single thing. Not a program, or the
data quality or a pipeline. Beacue invariably somethiings going to go wrong,

  <li>It’s going to force you to redo work somewhere farther down the line,
costing you time and effort that you could have prevented.</li>

<p>or</p>

  <li>This error will creep its way into your analysis. Causing doubt and
uncertainty in research that’s is already filled with noise and complex
variables. The worst scenario here is you either try to explain an error away
as a biological oddity, and you publish this data.</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s challenging to constantly be questioning your outpouts. Often time you
just wnat to accept the result of a pipeline and pretesnd that it’s correct.
However this is a mistake. One that i’ve made countless times. So, below is a
list of things that i need to personally do more to ensure that what im doing
doesnt result in one of the two above scenarios.</p>

<h2 id="always-check-the-output">Always Check the Output:</h2>

<p>No Matter the program something that i alywas atcivly try to do is eye the
output file and ask myself a few questions such as, does this output make sense
and is it the right file type? Is the size something that I would expect? Is
there a way to quality check this file, or oculd i write something to check it
myself?</p>

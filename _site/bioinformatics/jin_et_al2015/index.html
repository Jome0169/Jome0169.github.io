				<p>Understanding the landscape of histone readers is of crucial importance to my
reserach. These proteins which recognize, and recruit various complexes and
proteins to post tranlational modification (PTMs) cause many of the correlated
effects of we recognize in epigenomic research. For example, when methylation
is added to a lysine on the alpha globulin tail of a histone (K36 in this
instance), this methylation has no direct effect on
altering the chromatin like acetylation does. Rather it affects transcription
by recruiting a series of readers which in turn recruit more factors. And so
the chromatin cylcle of influcence continues.</p>

<p>An essential mark I use to identify novel transcription regions in monocots is
H3K36me3. So in turn, I wanted to read a paper getting into the identification
of a reader enzyme for this specific mark. Enter Jin et al, 2015, “MORF-RELATED
GENE702, a Reader Protein of Trimethylated Histone H3 Lysine 4 and Histone H3
Lysine 36, Is Involved in Brassinosteroid-Regulated Growth and Flowering Time
Control in Rice”. A paper diving into this very question.</p>

<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>The basic set-up of this paper is this group had previously identifed two
proteins in Arabidopsis that recognize H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, namely
MORF RELATED GENE (MRG) 1 &amp; 2 via their chromodomains, and a series of
functional studies. Therefor, this group was curious how MRG would operate in
monocots since it had only been tested in dicots. So, they chose to investigate
this proteins function in rice.</p>

<h4 id="experiments">Experiments</h4>
<p>This group initially tested the expression of MRG702 and MRG 701, ortholgs of
the Arabidposis version. Found that MRG 702 was the more up-regulated version,
and used this as evidence to call it the more important functional copy.</p>

<p>They they generated knock-down version of 702, and both 701 and 702. They
discovered that the knockdown of 702 had an almost identical phenotype to
knocking out both, allowing the scientist to conclude that 702 is the more
important protein here as the phenotype wasn’t exacterbated at all.</p>

<p>I have to say, the knockdown phenotypes look pretty good! They also had a smart
decision here where they also knocked down the histone methyltransferase
responsible for laying down H3K36me3. This allowed the authors to compare
knockouts putativly in similar pathways. Interestingly similar phenotypes were
found, pointing to the fact that these are more than likely operating in the
same genetic pathway.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Jin_et_al_2015_imgs/Jin_plants.png" alt="Pretty Plants!" /></p>

<p>Figures #2 and #3 basically get at the phenotypes of these knockouts, and while
they look somewhat striking, they rely on a few test of Brassinosteroid
sensing, and flowering time that I don’t like very much. For first their
assays, while I’m sure valuable, are incredibly domain specific, and make me
question how valuable they really are.</p>

<p>Second, I have an issue with this studies repeated use of RT-PCR at a few
select loci. When measuring complex phenotypes, they attempt to use previous
literature to select loci that they beleive should have signifigantly different
expression from their knockouts. While this appears to be true, I would have
preffered if this lab had done RNA seq to look at a more global level of
transcription. Since this reader is more than likely not targeted to this
single pathway, I would have found it more convincing if they had demonstrated
this on a global level.</p>

<p>Figure #4 is in my opinion the second key figure of this entire paper. It
illustrates that in a dot blot assay link:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_blot (a varient of western where you basically
don’t get size information), you find specific binding of MRG702 for H3K36me3,
and both H3K4me2 and H3K4me3. Basically, big poing MRG702 has histone
specificity!!! Woo!</p>

<p><img src="/images/Jin_et_al_2015_imgs/Jin_dot_blot.png" alt="Dot Plot" /></p>

<p>Finally, the authors do ChIP, and demonstrate that MRG702 binding acts on
H3K36me3, and use a 725Ri-i mutant (SDG8 mutant) to demonstrate the MRG702
binds to known loci whith H3K36me3 deposited, and that in the abscence of this
methylation (mutatnt), you no longer MRG binding. Pretty neat!!!</p>

<h4 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h4>
<p>A solid paper overall that I believe did a decent job identifying a reader of
H3K36me3 in Oryza sativa. I still wish the authors didn’t use rt-PCRl, and
instead had done RNA-seq as well as ChIP-seq. But I recognize I have some
intense genomic bias in this.</p>

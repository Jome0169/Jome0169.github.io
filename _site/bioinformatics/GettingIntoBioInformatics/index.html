				<p>This is a question I see all the time online. It has many variants, but the
most frequent I see is something like - “Where should I start, and what do i need to learn to get into bioinformatics?”.</p>

<p>So, in the hopes of providing at least decent guidance to others who are just getting started or interested in getting started in the field, I wanted to write a brief post about how I got started, and what I did to actually learn bioinformatics.</p>

<p>This guide it by no means intensive introduction to the field, nor is it meant to be. The reality is that genomics is far too vast and large for me to try and 
everything the field encompasses. Rather, I’ll just be highlighting a few fundamental building blocks that’ll get you started, and point you in a direction.</p>

<h5 id="the-very-beginning">1. The Very Beginning</h5>

<p>The first thing you must absolutely learn is command line. Command line is a
simplified method in which you can access and interact with your computer. Instead of using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">graphical user interface</a>(GUI for short), you’ll be interacting with your computer on a more basal level.</p>

<p>Most bioinformatics software is not created to be run with a GUI. The designers
of said softwares are far more focused on results rather than creating a
simplified programming interface. So this means that learning the command line
and being proficient in it is of massive importance. I would go so far as to
say that if you can’t use the command line or refuse to learn, you can’t do
bioinformatics on any discernible level.</p>

<p>But have no fear! Because I promise you that command line is not nearly as
intimidating as it might sound. On a very basic level your computer can be
thought of as a series of folders strucutred in a tree, with different folders
holding different files.</p>

<p>To learn the ins and ours of command line i would reccomend a few places to
start. If you’re technophobic and a little unsure of yourself i would reccomend
Code Academys command line course. Code Academy offers users the oppertunity to beggin learning the basics of using command lines on a ocmputer without the need to worry if you’re “messing up” your computer. But once you complete this step I would highly encourage you to begin working on command line on your own computer. There is no subsitution for repeated practice.</p>

<h5 id="the-actual-programming">2. The Actual Programming</h5>

<p>While learning the command line is a crucial step in bioinforamtics, learning
to program and script are fundamental and important skills any developing
bioinformatician must learn.</p>

<p>Often times the output from software isn’t exactly what you want. Or it simply
won’t be imputed very easily due to the nature of the file format. The best
solution to this issue is to begin teaching yourself ‘scripting’. Scripting can
basically be thought of as writing small pieces of code that can help you
impute different types of data to a more reasonable format. At a basic level if
can make working with text files a much easier affair, and at a higher level it
opens up avenues of publishing bioinforamtics software.</p>

<p>At first scripting can seem like and inconquerable task. It can seem like the
difference between</p>

<h5 id="getting-to-know-the-greatest-hits">3. Getting to Know The “Greatest Hits”</h5>

<h5 id="creating-projects">4. Creating Projects</h5>

<h5 id="reading-scienctific-articles">5. Reading Scienctific Articles</h5>

<p>This is an aspect of bioinformatics/genomics that I believe is heavily
understated in most “intro” guides. While many such guides instruct you to get
a handle and grasp on programming, far fewer discuss the necessity of reading
everything you possibly can related to the field. With whatever you end up
pursiong there’s no point in redoing work that has been done by a precursor.
Why try and create a genome assembler without knowing the current
methadologies. Reading, and reserach is crucial.</p>

<p>Something I found to be</p>

<h5 id="continue-to-learn">6. Continue to Learn</h5>

<p>The last point I’ll make in this list is that this list is far from exhaustive.
Bioinforamtics is a massive field that is only getting more complex and
advanced as time goes on. This puts the task of continuoius development
direcltly on the individual. There comes a point where no one can teach you
everything you must learn, so it’s up to you to figure out what you need to
learn, and how to learn it.</p>

<p>The best people in thie field are those who have a voracious desire to learn
and understand. My advice is to keep trying, and keep advancing. It’s amazing
what consisten effort can yield even if you don’t belive yourself to be gifted</p>

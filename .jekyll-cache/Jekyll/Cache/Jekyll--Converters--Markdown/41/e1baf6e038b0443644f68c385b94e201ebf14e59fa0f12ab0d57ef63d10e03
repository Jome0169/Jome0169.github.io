I"á<p>So, I was interestd in running the software peakranger bcp recently, but
stumbeled into a rather irritating probelm. I kept getting the classic message
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Segmentation fault (core dumped)</code>. Upon looking around for the solution to
this problem I found nothing. So I thought I would document briefly what I did
to fix it.</p>

Segmentation fault (core dumped)

<p>Upon investigating this further, I decided to see if the issue was coming from the scaffold reported in the error, B73V4_ctg162. To see check this I first analysed how many reads were aligning to this contig in the maize genome using  using a quick samtools command:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#Command:
samtools idxstats chip_B73_ear_H3K36me3_rep1_bowtie2algn.sorted.bam | grep B73V4_ctg162

#Output:
B73V4_ctg162    40634   0       0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, there were ZERO reads aligning to this contig. Making me think the software might be chocking on this scaffold. But after removing this scaffold from the SAM file, I was still being greated by <code class="highlighter-rouge">Segmentation fault (core dumped)</code> . So, in order to try again I took a more drastic measure removed all scaffolds that had CTG in them. I did this after checking the gff3 file for all scaffolds/contigs, and coming to the conclusion that none of them are particularly gene rich and/or interesting for my questions. I removed ALL of these scaffolds using the following command:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>grep -v "B73V4_ctg*" chip_rep1_bowtie2algn.sam  &gt; chip_rep1_bowtie2algn.noctg_scaff.sam &amp;&amp; grep -v "B73V4_ctg*" chip_rep1_bowtie2algn.sam  &gt; chip_rep1_bowtie2algn.noctg_scaff.sam 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I eventuall re-ran this software using these generated SAM (I didnâ€™t want to take the extra step of going from <code class="highlighter-rouge">samtools view | grep _v </code> back to sam) files, and was eventually rewarded with:</p>

<p>Success! It appears that those nasty scaffolds/contigs were proving to be quite troublesome for this software. But, this isnâ€™t an ideal solution. Weâ€™re still casting out genomic information that I would prefer to keep for analysis. Soâ€¦ There has to be a smarter way of doing this. Maybe pin pointing the exact scaffolds that were failing and why? But in my case, this got me the desired results I needed.</p>

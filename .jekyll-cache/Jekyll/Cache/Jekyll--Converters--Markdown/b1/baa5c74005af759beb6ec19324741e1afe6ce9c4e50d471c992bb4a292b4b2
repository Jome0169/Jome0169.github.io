I"Õ<p>This is a question I see all the time online. It has many variants, but the
most frequent I see goes something like - ‚ÄúWhere should I start, and what do I need to learn to get into bioinformatics/genomics?‚Äù. So, in the hopes of providing decent answer to those just getting started in the field, I wanted to write a brief post with the hopes of pointing you in the right direction. This guide it by no means intensive introduction to the field, nor is it meant to be. The reality is that bioinformatics as a field is far too vast and large for me to try and  describe everything you will need to learn. Rather, I‚Äôll just be highlighting a few powerful building blocks that‚Äôll get you started quicklky.</p>

I"…<p>Understanding the landscape of histone readers is of crucial importance to my
reserach. These proteins which recognize, and recruit various complexes and
proteins to post tranlational modification (PTMs) cause many of the correlated
effects of we recognize in epigenomic research. For example, when methylation
is added to a lysine on the alpha globulin tail of a histone (K36 in this
instance), this methylation has no direct effect on
altering the chromatin like acetylation does. Rather it affects transcription
by recruiting a series of readers which in turn recruit more factors. And so
the chromatin cylcle of influcence continues.</p>

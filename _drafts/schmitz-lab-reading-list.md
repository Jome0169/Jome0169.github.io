title: My new draft
---

I'm going to cut straight to the chase. There are a tone of papers you need to
read if you're working in the field of gene regulation in plants. Especially if
you're interested in features of the epigenome, and how assays of chromatin,
methylations, and small RNAs can be leveraged to answer all sorts of biological
questions. With that in mind, here is my non exhaustive list of papers which
you NEED to read. 

Sections are broken down by phenomena we're interested in. Subsections then
outline historical papers to read, current reviews, and what I think is some of
the most valuable literature you need to read.

Let me know if you think I'm missing a paper

An Idiots Guide to Iso-seq analaysis


So, in case you've been living in a hole in the ground, pac-bios iso-seq method
stands to drastically change the game (so they say) in regards to RNA -
sequencing. This method which allows you to capture full length cDNA is
arguably a more efficient and accurate method of sequencing and capturing RNA
molecules.

However, while all this might be true, the guides to using Iso-seq data using
the command line, as well as downloading reads from NCBI remains pretty much
vacant. So, here i am.

Also - this shit feels needlessly complicated. Funny how without either a
`flaminghottommy` blog post or a `davetang` post I feel utterly lost. Light a
candle for our boys.


First - download reads. The read set I'm downloading is from Zea Mays, for the
most recent genome annotation of version 5. Reads can be found here:

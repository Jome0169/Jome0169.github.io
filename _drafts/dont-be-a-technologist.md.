In the immortal words of Gucci Mane  ["If a man does not have the sauce, then he
is lost. But the same man can be lost in the sauce."]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F88c6Hrk these are words I've
returned to often when thinking about the nature of bioinformatics. The slight
but signifigant difference of someone using bioinformatics as a tool to answer
biological questions, and those who simply wish to implement a shiny new technique or
method and rush to it with no purpose or objective in mind. Thinking that
somehow, at the end of the day, insights will just fall from their
implementaion like so many ripe apples.

Hoenstly, I see it all to commonly now adays. And the main reason I feel like
I'm able to identify it is I used to be the exact same way. And in some way...
Maybe I am stil that way. But hopefully a bit more cognizent. 

But there's this phrase i've heard many an early bioinformatician whisper -
something along the lines of "I want to work on a transcriptiome" or "I want 
to work with X kind of tata". And at some point you quickly stop and need to ask an
essential question. WHY? What will that teach you? What can you learn from
that technique that can be learned from techniques already known? What are your questions? 

And most importantly - where on EARTH is your biology?

Just take some time - and make sure you're not getting lost in the sauce

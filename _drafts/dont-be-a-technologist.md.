In the immortal words of Gucci Mane  ["If a man does not have the sauce, then he
is lost. But the same man can be lost in the sauce."]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0-F88c6Hrk these are words I've
returned to often when thinking about the nature of bioinformatics. The slight
but signifigant difference of someone using bioinfoarmtics as a tool to answer
biological questions, and those who simply look at a shimy new technique and
rush to it.

Section - techniques are neet, but they don't matter

    Rna has a use - but


I realize any remakrs coming from me are most likely fairly meaningless. I am
only a first year graduate student. But I feel as if i've had enough moments of
'new data syndrome' where I've finally come to terms with a few realities of
biology. And let me make this clear - I'm not targeting anyone in partciular,
I've been as much guilty of these ideas and actions as anyone else. 

But there's this phrase i've heard many an early bioinforamtician whisper -
something along the lines of "I want to work on a transcriptiome" or "I wanna
do X kinda sequecing". And at some point you quickly stop and need to ask an
essential question. WHY? What will that teach you? What can you learn from
sequenxing the transcriptome? What are your questions? 

And most importantly - where on EARTH is your biology?


Just take some time - and make sure you're not getting lost in the sauce

title: My First Week with R
---


This week I set a goal for myself - get better with the R programming language.
It has been on the graduate school ageneda for ages. My reasoning for learning
R is as follows: R is the language
franca of statistics in the sciences. If you see a cool figure in a paper, or
see a sick graphic on twitter, it probably came from R. Also... all the cools kids use
R, so... Why shouldn't I?

### Growing Pains

I'm a python boy. I admit it willingly and honestly. I love the syntax, the
ease of the language, and how powerful even it's most basic data types are. In
python... there's usually one right way to do something. The 'pythonic' way. 

Transversly, R is... an atrisans language. 1001 ways to do anything the heart
desires. You want to save a figure? 34 ways to do that. Load a package? 5 ways
to do that. Subset a dataframe? That numbers approaching infinite there kiddo.
But I digress. R is a language that lets the programmer find their optima and
their own paraidgms. And coming from my neat pythonic linear world, I was
dreading it.

But I digress. R has had many of these issues ameloritaed by the invention of
the tidyverse by hadley wickam. The tidyverse can be thought of as optimizing the
best parts of R - while brushing much of the "messier" parts of the language
under the rug. Based off friends i've known who love the tidyverse - it kinda
seemed like the way to go. My learning resource for this - R for data science
and visualization (By motha fuckin HADLEY WICKAM HIMSELF) https://r4ds.had.co.nz . This book is phenomenal for anyone looking for a basic text that cuts out the BS and quickly teaches you the neccessary skills you need.

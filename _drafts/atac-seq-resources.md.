If you're unaware of ATAC-seq, that's quick to change. This fast method for
assaying accesible chromatin has been a powerful tool in the chromatin, and
functional genomics community going on 4 years, and arguably it has had
profound effects on our understanding of Cis-regulation.

By utilizing a TN5-transposase we're now able to ID regions of the genome that
are nucleosome free (possibly functional).

So, with
